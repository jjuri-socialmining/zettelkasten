***Marvell Confidential***

Team:

I’m sharing my note early this week to provide some context on organizational changes announced the past few days by several of our teams.

In recent years, we’ve more than doubled the revenue of Marvell and increased headcount significantly, adding more than 2,000 team members and several new sites to our global footprint. It’s been an incredible journey, and we are now strongly positioned in the most exciting and fastest growing end markets in our industry.
 
But there have been growing pains, too. As we’ve expanded, our engineering teams have become more spread out, often across multiple locations and time zones. In light of this, several groups are taking steps to better align their R&D footprint to their own growth plans, influenced by local market dynamics. In China, there is a push to use locally developed technology, and we are organizing our teams accordingly.

Specifically, those groups have realigned their R&D footprint in China to focus on local customers and business opportunities. While we’ve worked to limit the scope of these actions and redeploy talent wherever possible, they have affected a number of employees in China, and we are supporting them with a severance program and other forms of assistance as they leave the company. Those impacted by these changes have been notified. If you are one of these employees, I want you to know how much I appreciate your contributions to Marvell. We recognize the impact a decision like this can have and are committed to helping you with your transition.

For employees worldwide, thank you for your ongoing support and willingness to adapt and thrive in change.

Matt
