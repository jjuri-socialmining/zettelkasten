***Marvell Confidential***


Team:

You might have heard about a current trend called “quiet quitting.” It’s a topic that’s in the news, and it means that employees are staying in their jobs without giving their best. In fact, they’re likely doing the bare minimum to drag out their employment for as long as possible before they leave or wait/hope to be fired. In the past, quiet quitters were known as “disengaged employees.” For whatever reason, they no longer care.

What can strengthen someone’s commitment and inspire them to care? Is it their company’s campus amenities or the ability to sometimes work from home? I’m sure benefits like these are appreciated, but I’m not sure they drive outsized commitment to a company at the end of the day. Rather, people are committed when they care about their company’s success, the work they are doing, and the people they work with. They care about their manager and whether that person communicates effectively, provides fair and accurate feedback, advises on career development opportunities, and most of all - cares. Also, I think most people want to be part of a winning team, beating the competition and seeing the products they work on and support be wildly successful. It is hard to put a value on the satisfaction of great success.

Finding a way to win

When I look back at the challenges I’ve faced in my career, I’ve been strongly motivated to overcome them because I really cared about the places where I worked. I was an engaged employee and wanted us to win. I had managers and company leaders who supported me in my career development and growth – even when the support came in the form of “tough love”!

In my message last week, I told the story about how, earlier in my career, I encountered a problem that could have put a major customer at risk. We got the help we needed to recover – and it was because some of us, including the company’s CEO, really cared. Failure wasn’t an option. We were determined to find a way.

On another occasion, I had to deal with a serious quality problem on a high-volume product selling to one of the world’s largest cell phone companies. Sparing the details, at high temperatures and high humidity, there was a failure mode causing silver migration inside the package to trigger a power supply short, resulting in a whole bunch of cell phones in the field to literally stop working. Exposure was somewhere around 800,000 units at risk that had been shipped before the customer found the problem in the form of customer returns.

The customer wanted someone with authority to travel to Asia to discuss the problem, in person. Nobody wanted to go, including my boss (who was a VP) and our VP of Quality. Neither wanted to deal with an aggressive and hostile customer. Instead, they happily delegated to me and our head of customer quality – please book a flight to Asia ASAP! In my case, the trip massively conflicted with an important personal commitment, but I knew I needed to go. Someone had to deal with the problem head on. It wasn’t going to go away on its own and someone needed to step up.

When we arrived at the customer, the situation was tense because there was so much at stake. But just showing up calmed down the situation. After being in country for less than 24 hours, I raced feverishly to the airport to catch a flight to the destination of my personal commitment. In retrospect, the personal impact on me and others was minor, but the impact to my company was massive. The outsized effort was noted, and I became known as someone who would deal with problems head on and do whatever it took to make our customers successful.

Lessons learned

What did I learn from these experiences, in addition to the importance of caring and finding a way to win? Here are three more takeaways:
 
•	Embrace reality. First, we need to be candid about problems because only in the light of truth can they be resolved. Seasoned business leaders agree that candor is essential because it draws more people into the conversation. They can discuss, debate, and improve upon each other’s ideas, and the best ideas can be more quickly implemented. Candor enhances the speed of a business. Among the worst situations I have ever encountered is when a business is failing, but the “prior” leader had been telling the team that everything was great!
 
•	Admit when you’ve fallen short. That’s what my colleague and I did when we met with the cell phone manufacturer in Asia: we faced the music, acknowledged that our company had made mistakes, apologized, and made a commitment to fix the problem. It was the right thing to do, and it helped prevent a crisis. Despite the gravity of the impact, and some compensation paid to make things right, the relationship with that customer actually accelerated after that – and it became Maxim’s single largest customer by the time I left in 2016.
 
•	Move beyond your fears. When we genuinely care, we are willing to take on hard challenges and find a way. Showing up and dealing with it is more than half the battle!
 
Make an impact

Famed investor Sir John Templeton once said, “It is impossible to produce superior performance unless you do something different.” The problem therein is that doing something different means taking risk and putting yourself on the line. If you can’t push beyond your own internal voice, which may tell you things like: minimize risk, minimize effort, or minimize creative thinking, then you are not pushing yourself or others to achieve something greater.

We are a company of very smart people and very high achievers. I’m sure you have faced many challenges in your life and career and discovered new levels of strength and resilience as you worked through them. This experience can be exhilarating, and I encourage you to continually develop your amazing potential at Marvell. When it’s all said and done – what did I accomplish and what impact did I make? The pursuit of excellence is one of the most rewarding aspects of the human condition.

I am proud that Marvell is a highly-engaged company – you really care. We have a great opportunity in front of us. We have an amazing team of people, excellent technology and commitment to innovation, and a company culture where you can make an outsized impact on Marvell’s success as an employee. Let’s be bold as we work together to achieve more than we ever thought possible. Trust me, the satisfaction in the end, of giving it your all and getting great results is something you can be proud of for the rest of your life. In comparison to “quiet quitting” – isn’t the choice obvious?

Have a good week, everyone.

Matt
