As pointed out elsewhere in this FAQ, [philosophy is a very large field](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/4i0tgc/what_is_philosophy_what_do_philosophers_do_what/). You could spend your entire life studying political philosophy and never touch metaphysics, or vice versa. This makes it difficult to recommend good places to start for people who know nothing about philosophy: it's a bit like recommending a food to someone who has never eaten anything. Do you recommend a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? A South Indian dal? Roasted Brussels sprouts? Tacos?

This FAQ answer, therefore, will focus on two main things. First, it will list some general overviews that will help you get familiar with various parts of philosophy and help you figure out where your interests lie, if they do in fact lie anywhere in philosophy. Second, it will list some good starting points for various topics that newcomers are commonly interested in.

Good General Overviews

This section divides into two: short, broad overviews, and more extensive histories.

Short, Broad Overviews

Two good places to start are [Simon Blackburn's book _Think_](http://smile.amazon.com/Think-A-Compelling-Introduction-Philosophy/dp/0192854259) and [Julian Baggini's _The Pig That Wants to be Eaten_](http://smile.amazon.com/Pig-That-Wants-Eaten-Experiments/dp/0452287448). The Blackburn book clearly and concisely goes through most of the large areas of philosophy and talks about how various philosophers have thought about them. The Baggini book presents interesting little thought experiments and puzzles that can help acquaint you with some of the interesting and odd topics that philosophers have addressed. Both books provide enough citations for you to start digging on your own once you've identified things you find interesting.

Four other broad starting points are [Kwame Anthony Appiah's _Thinking It Through_](https://smile.amazon.com/Thinking-Through-Introduction-Contemporary-Philosophy/dp/0195134583), [Thomas Nagel's book _What Does It All Mean?_](http://smile.amazon.com/What-Does-All-Mean-Introduction/dp/0195052161/), [Bertrand Russell's book _The Problems of Philosophy_](http://smile.amazon.com/Problems-Philosophy-Bertrand-Russell/dp/1604595132), and [this collection of five dialogues written by Plato](http://smile.amazon.com/Plato-Dialogues-Euthyphro-Apology-Classics/dp/0872206335/) (Plato's dialogues can also be found free online, although the translations are not always great). The Appiah, Nagel, and Russell books cover fewer topics - basically, they hit some things that Appiah, Nagel, and Russell find interesting - and Plato can be tough to read on your own, which is why these are not my top recommendations, but they can serve as good introductions to the field of philosophy if you're starting from zero. The Appiah book is the most comprehensive of the three.

Next, a book that is often recommended to newcomers is [Jostein Gaarder's book _Sophie's World_](http://smile.amazon.com/Sophies-World-History-Philosophy-Classics/dp/0374530718/). It's a novel that also tries to introduce people to the various ideas of philosophy. I'm not the biggest fan of the book - its method of teaching philosophy sometimes reduces to "the main character receives a letter that contains a lesson on philosophy," which I find clunky - but many people enjoy it, so I would say it comes highly recommended except from me.

Finally, there's Andrew Bailey's _First Philosophy_ series which sounds good but I've never read it.

More Extensive Histories

If you're particularly industrious, or if you want to focus on non-Western philosophy, you could read more extensive books that are proper introductions to the history of philosophy. [Will Durant's _The Story of Philosophy_](http://smile.amazon.com/Story-Philosophy-Opinions-Greatest-Philosophers/dp/0671739166) and [Anthony Kenny's _A New History of Western Philosophy_](http://smile.amazon.com/New-History-Western-Philosophy/dp/0199656495/) are good choices for Western philosophy, and [Joel Kupperman's _Classic Asian Philosophy_](http://smile.amazon.com/Classic-Asian-Philosophy-Guide-Essential/dp/0195189817/) and [Brian Van Norden's _Introduction to Classic Chinese Philosophy_](http://smile.amazon.com/Introduction-Classical-Chinese-Philosophy-Norden/dp/1603844686/) are good for Chinese and Asian philosophy. [Victoria Harrison's _Eastern Philosophy: The Basics_](http://smile.amazon.com/Eastern-Philosophy-Victoria-S-Harrison/dp/0415587336) covers India and China, and it's particularly short compared to the others - it sits somewhere between a proper history and the more summary-focused works noted above. Frederick Copleston has a ten volume _History of Philosophy_ that is also good, although it's slightly hard to get ahold of these days.

With all of these histories of philosophy, there are three things to keep in mind. First, they are partial, both in the narrow sense (not even Copleston hits every important Western philosopher) and in the broad sense (philosophy from outside the West exists in all sorts of forms that don't show up in these books) so, if you'd like, you may want to start your investigation in an entirely different area. Second, philosophers disagree with each other over what philosophers in the past were saying, and although these histories are generally good about pointing this out, you should never take everything you read as the gospel truth. Third, lots of people find diving into a big long history (the Kenny book is 1000 pages!) to be pretty dry and boring. So, unless you're the sort of person who likes to read a lot of stuff, a history tome might not be a good place to start.

More Specific Places to Start

We'll subdivide this into two sections. First, there are some good places to start for philosophy generally, if you're the sort of person who says "it's all interesting - I don't want to specialize!" Second, there are good places to start for various topics.

Good Places to Start for Philosophy Generally

As mentioned above, **Plato** is a good place to dive in. He sits near the beginning of the Western philosophical tradition, his writing is often engaging, he covers practically every topic, and he was massively influential. In addition to [this collection of five dialogues](http://smile.amazon.com/Plato-Dialogues-Euthyphro-Apology-Classics/dp/0872206335/), Plato's _Republic_ is a masterpiece that touches on many areas of philosophy and which has often served as the first introduction students get to the field.

_The Meditations_ by **Marcus Aurelius** are focused on Stoicism, an overarching philosophy somewhat popular in Greek and Roman times. The somewhat personal style and the wide range of topics he touches on, plus the historical interest of reading something written not just by a philosopher but also an Emperor of Rome, make it a fun introduction to philosophy for many people.

**Descartes** was a revolutionary thinker who helped usher in the modern period. Two great places to start with Descartes are his _Discourse on the Method_ and his _Meditations on First Philosophy_, both of which are available [here](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/descartes).

Good Places to Start for Specific Topics

We're subdividing again! One option is to go for primary sources - classic works in philosophy on these topics. Another option is to go for introductory textbooks or compilations of works.

Primary Sources

Everyone has a favorite philosopher for any given topic, but it's always a different philosopher depending on who you ask. So, this section could balloon almost infinitely. But it won't. So, keep in mind that for every philosopher that's listed here, there are three others that someone might say "no, read THIS PERSON first!" That's life.

Moreover, philosophy is a super broad field. We cannot here cover every topic. That's also life.

This list skews slightly early in history, because it is generally better to start closer to the beginning. Sometimes people find it more exciting to jump in closer to the modern age. If that's the case, I recommend introductory textbooks listed below.

Finally, I am not super familiar with non-Western Philosophy. Unless someone with more knowledge comes along and offers some suggestions (thus allowing me to remove this disclaimer) the list below is _very_ parochial. (Also, I've left off all of medieval philosophy since I think it's often boring for newcomers. Sorry. If you have some exciting medievals to suggest, I can add them to the list.)

For **epistemology**, which is the study of knowledge and how we come to have it, Plato's _Theaetetus_, [Descartes's _Discourse on the Method_ and _Meditations on First Philosophy_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/descartes), [Locke's _Essay Concerning Human Understanding_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/locke), [Leibniz's _New Essays on Human Understanding_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/leibniz) (read that right after Locke), [Berkeley's _The Principles of Human Knowledge_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/berkeley), and [Hume's _An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/hume).

For **metaphysics**, which is the study of what exists, what existence is, and why things do or don't exist, all that stuff up there in the epistemology section, minus Locke, Leibniz, and Hume, and plus Plato's _Phaedo_, maybe Aristotle's _Metaphysics_ (it's tough), [Leibniz's _Discourse on Metaphysics_ and _Monadology_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/leibniz) and [Kant's _Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/kant).

For **aesthetics**, which is the study of beauty and art, Plato's _Hippias Major_, Aristotle's _Poetics_, [Hume's _The Standard of Taste_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/hume), and if you're up for it, Kant's _Critique of Judgment_.

For **ethics**, Plato's _Republic_, Mozi's _Mozi_, Aristotle's _Nicomachean Ethics_, [Hume's _An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/hume), and [Kant's _Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/kant).

For **political philosophy**, Plato's _Republic_ and _Crito_, Aristotle's _Politics_, Cicero's _On the Commonwealth_ and _On the Laws_, [Machiavelli's _The Prince_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/machiavelli), [Hobbes's _Leviathan_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/hobbes), and [Locke's _Second Treatise of Government_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/locke).

For **existentialism and absurdism**, [Sartre's _Existentialism is a Humanism_](http://smile.amazon.com/Existentialism-Humanism-Jean-Paul-Sartre/dp/0300115466/) and [Camus's _The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays_](http://smile.amazon.com/Myth-Sisyphus-Other-Essays/dp/0679733736/).

For **philosophy of science**, which is the study of what science is and how science comes to know things, [Mill's _A System of Logic_ book III](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/mill), Popper's _Conjectures and Refutations_, [Kuhn's _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_](http://smile.amazon.com/Structure-Scientific-Revolutions-50th-Anniversary/dp/0226458121/), and _For and Against Method_ edited by Motterlini. Lots of people find Mill boring, though, and philosophy of science is rather new, so you might be better served by the textbooks or compilations listed below.

For **feminism**, [Wollstonecraft's _A Vindication of the Rights of Women_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/wollstonecraft), [Mill's (or Mill and Taylor Mill's) _The Subjection of Women_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/mill), and [de Beauvoir's _The Second Sex_](https://smile.amazon.com/Second-Sex-Simone-Beauvoir/dp/030727778X/).

For **philosophy of religion**, Plato's _Euthyphro_, [Leibniz's _Making the Case for God_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/leibniz), [Hume's _Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion_ and _The Immortality of the Soul_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/hume), and [Kant's _Religion Within the Boundaries of Bare Reason_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/authors/kant).

Introductory Textbooks

Maybe you want something that covers more ground faster, or that's pitched towards the modern reader, or which doesn't assume any prior knowledge. In that case, textbooks are good.

Compilations of Works

One way to make quick buck is to grab a bunch of important stuff and stick it in a book, then sell it to people. Thankfully when philosophers do this, it makes it easy to get into a topic.

Other Options

Rather than reading a book, you might want to start by [watching some YouTube videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/7o6pm0/what_are_some_good_philosophy_youtube_channels/?st=jqtl2qrr&sh=06d993f7), [listening to some podcasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/4i0faz/what_are_some_good_philosophy_podcasts/), browsing around [a philosophical encyclopedia](http://plato.stanford.edu/), or, best of all, taking a philosophy course, either while you're in university or via something like a local community college or an online course ([Shelly Kagan's course on death is very popular](http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176)). These are great ways to get more acquainted with philosophy.
