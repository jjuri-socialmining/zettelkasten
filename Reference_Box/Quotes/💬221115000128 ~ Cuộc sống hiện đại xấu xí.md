## Notes:
> Life, I knew, was supposed to be more joyful than this, more real, more meaningful, and the world was supposed to be more beautiful.14 We were not supposed to hate Mondays and live for the weekends and holidays. We were not supposed to have to raise our hands to be allowed to pee. We were not supposed to be kept indoors on a beautiful day, day after day.
