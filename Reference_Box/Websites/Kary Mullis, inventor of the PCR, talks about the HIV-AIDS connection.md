### Quan hệ nhân quả giữa virus và bệnh
Time stamp: [0:16](https://youtu.be/9vuxibKj4z8?t=16)

> there was a particular kind of disease there. It was cancer kind of thing and there also was this virus there that he hadn't found anywhere else. he hadn't looked anywhere else either. 
you know and that didn't bother bob.
he announced that he had found cause of one kind of cancer which was supposed to help him get another 500 000 grant from the federal government the next year because he published something finally of all these people that were at the national cancer institute trying to show that viruses could cause cancer he was the only one that had shown it and the reason he was the only one is because he didn't believe in the scientific method he didn't even think about the fact that you can't pin causality just on the fact that the two were there together i didn't cause you we're here together

Ý chính:
- Không thể khẳng định quan hệ nhân quả virus X là nguyên nhân gây bệnh Y nếu nó tìm thấy trong 1 người mang bệnh. Theo [[The Terrain Theory]] virus là các [[Exosomes]] được tổng hợp khi cơ thể nhiễm độc và có nhiệm vụ giải độc. Xem thêm:
	-  [[Bốn định đề Robert Koch  xác định vi sinh vật có là nguồn gốc gây ra bệnh cụ thể hay không]]
	-  [[Sáu định đề Thomas Rivers xác định 1 virus cụ thể có gây ra bệnh cụ thể không]]
	-  [[Antoine Bechamp và Pasteur về lý thuyết vi khuẩn]]. 

-> Quay lại với vấn đề [[COVID-19]], có nghiện cứu nào chứng minh quan hệ nhân quả và 6 định đề của [[Thomas Rivers]]. Hay cũng chỉ làm theo như cách mà [[Kary B. Mullis]] nói ở trên?

### CDC
Time stamp: [9:10](https://youtu.be/9vuxibKj4z8?t=550): 

[[Kary B. Mullis]] nói về [[CDC]], [[Ebola]]

### [[Virus HIV]] and [[AIDS]]

> you can go to the internet and you can say "aids cause" return going out to vista something like that bang you'll get papers the first 20 hits you get out of those there will probably be about six or seven that suggest that there is no evidence okay there will be not a single one that suggests that there is evidence for a causal relation between those two things 

-> Mullis nói: Không có bằng chứng khoa học nào chứng minh nguyên nhân (a causal relation- mối quan hệ nhân quả) gây [[AIDS]] là  [[Virus HIV]]

> now when i was working down the street here it was down that way down toward michigan street a place called specialty labs.
i was working for those guys three or four days a month and i was setting up tests to look for viruses like hiv in the blood supply for la and since there were so many people in la that was going to be a it was a pretty hard to see how you're going to test all the all that's about thousand bottles every day so we had to put a lot of effort into it and it'd be we've been successful and i was having to write that up for the people who had paid for it which is your representative government and i was writing this little paragraph and i said i've got to explain why we were doing it in the first place so i said well hiv is the probable cause of aids that was my first sentence because i thought it was because that's what i'd heard and i hadn't questioned it i just heard it i said well if all these people think that's true there's probably evidence back there somewhere that suggests it and so i asked somebody what what reference what little work of scientific reporting should i quote so that somebody interest interested in finding out why i thought that could find out himself the guy said the guy that i asked was the wrong person asked he said you don't have to quote that you don't have to say everybody knows it i said well i don't know why i know it i just know that i heard it and in a scientific thing it's a lot different from a movie where all you have to do is have a character say something you want to have as a fact in a scientific publication you are required

-> Theo Mullis: các bài viết khoa học không trích dẫn bằng chứng khoa học, chỉ đơn thuần dẫn chứng vì mọi người đều biết nó, chỉ bởi vì đã nghe nó và những người khác cũng biết.
