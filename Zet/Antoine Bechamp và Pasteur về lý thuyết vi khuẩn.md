		> Back in the 1850’s two Frenchman, [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Antoine Beauchamp]], both had bacteriological theories of disease, but they disagreed. Pasteur promoted what is referred as the “germ theory”. “Beauchamp believed that the bacteria, microbes, viruses, and fungi that were being blamed as the CAUSE of disease, were actually part of God’s “cleanup crew” breaking down sick tissue and ultimately decomposing a no-longer occupied body.”
