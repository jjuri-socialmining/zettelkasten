Today , November 14th, we taped out the optimized version of Alaska A ASIC (aka Lynx) for the Active Electrical Cable (AEC) market.

The adoption of 100G/Lane in next generation Data Centers, requires advanced cabling solutions to meet the reach, flexibility and power requirements that are provided by Lynx enabled AEC products (200G, 400G, 800G and 1.6T).  At OCP, Marvell and our partners have recently announced availability of AEC samples based on Lynx for OEM and hyperscale datacenters.

This version of Lynx is a power optimized spin of the 6nm Capella_B SERDES chip. The Capella_B version of Lynx will be released to production shortly and drive sales until “optimized Lynx” is available. The power reduction and superior performance of the Capella SERDES provides a bulwark against analog competitors.

Key features include:

-   Low power differential transmit driver
-   0.65V core operation
-   Deterministic through path latency control
-   Known Good Die support

This tape out was a great demonstration of teamwork across design centers all over the world. The HCM Vietnam team was responsible for RTL/DV/DFT/PD/PV/STA. California, Ottawa and Singapore drove analog changes. Subject matter experts from the US, Canada and Romania provided valuable support and leadership.

A big thanks to the entire team enabling this important milestone achieved for Marvell.
