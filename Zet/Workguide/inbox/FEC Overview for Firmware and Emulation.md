## Note
Reed-Solomon FEC encoding calculate message and appending a codeword to message
Decode a codeword, calculate syndrome, if syndrome is 0, there is no errors.


Basics

Two encoding supported:
- KR: [[RS(528, 514)]] 14 parity symbols, T=7
- KP: [[RS(544, 514)]] 30 parity symbols, T=15

- [ ] KP add 300 parity bit, why output 544/528 times faster than input? [[RS(544, 514)]]? why 528, not 514? #tasks/todo/research 

RS symbols are distributed to FEC lanes, each FEC lane has alignment markers. AM are used to reorder FEC lanes.


- T represents the number of Error that can be corrected
- KR: T=7: codeword with 1-7 errors are correctable
- KP, T=15: codeword with 1-15 errors are correctable

KP and KR are different FEC

There are two types of FEC methods used in Falcon:
1.  Fire Code FEC (FC-FEC), used primarily for 10G ports with lower latency and error correction
2.  Reed-Solomon FEC (RS-FEC), used for 25G to 100G ports with higher latency,
