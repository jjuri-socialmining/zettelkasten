Hi, I pushed some changes on the register web browser but it looks like the jenkins job that restarts the browser didn't start.

it was just a momentary hiccup in Jenkins, if you check something in and notice the registers haven't updated then just manually run the jenkins job [jenkins jobs](http://sw.inphi-corp.local/jenkins/job/admin_registers_webpage/)
