> Do you have any guide, suggestion or document on how to drive CTC2? I was trying to communicate with it as 2 separate CTCA with offset but I get conflicts since the offset can be used for both the 2nd CTCA or the 2nd IP of the first CTCA. I also tried accessing only the first CTCA but it looks like CTC2 does not support calibration like a regular CTCA? Because when it reached calibration step it hanged.
