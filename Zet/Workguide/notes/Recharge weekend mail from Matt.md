Team:

I hope you are enjoying your Recharge Weekend and taking a well-deserved break. I strongly encourage you to disconnect from work as much as you can during this time.

You might recall that we started Recharge Weekends at the beginning of the pandemic, when many of us were finding it hard to draw a line between our work lives and personal lives. Also, at the time, some of us were not using our vacation days to get away. Having a four-day weekend, synchronized globally, gave us an opportunity (and reminder) to slow down, spend some extra time with family and friends, focus on our health, and engage in other activities we enjoy.

I hope you enjoy your time away from work, and as always, if youâ€™ve been unable to take off this weekend due to pressing matters at Marvell, please work with your manager to find another time to take a break.

Have a great long weekend, everyone.

Matt
