## 73.6 [[Link Codeword]]

[[DME page]]

Defined in [[802.3-2015_SECTION5.pdf]] 
> The base link codeword (Base Page) transmitted within a DME page shall convey the encoding shown in
Figure 73–6. The Auto-Negotiation function supports additional pages using the Next Page function.
Encoding for the link codeword(s) used in the Next Page exchange are defined in 73.7.7. In a DME page, D0
shall be the first bit transmitted.

> D[4:0] contains the Selector Field. D[9:5] contains the Echoed Nonce field. D[12:10] contains capability
bits to advertise capabilities not related to the PHY. C[1:0] is used to advertise pause capability. The
remaining capability bit C[2] is reserved. D[15:13] contains the RF, Ack, and NP bits. These bits shall
function as specified in 28.2.1.2. D[20:16] contains the Transmitted Nonce field. D[45:21] contains the
Technology Ability Field. D[47:46] contains FEC capability (see 73.6.5).

### 73.6.7 [[Remote Fault]]


### 73.6.8 Acknowledge


Defined in [[802.3-2015_SECTION5.pdf]] 
> Acknowledge (Ack) is used by the Auto-Negotiation function to indicate that a device has successfully
received its link partner’s link codeword. The Acknowledge Bit is encoded in bit D14 of link codeword. If
no Next Page information is to be sent, this bit shall be set to logical one in the link codeword after the
reception of at least three consecutive and consistent DME pages (ignoring the Acknowledge bit value). If
Next Page information is to be sent, this bit shall be set to logical one after the device has successfully
received at least three consecutive and matching DME pages (ignoring the Acknowledge bit value), and will
remain set until the Next Page information has been loaded into the AN XNP transmit register (Registers
7.22, 7.23, 7.24). In order to save the current received link codeword, it must be read from the AN LP XNP
ability register (Register 7.25, 7.26, 7.27) before the Next Page of transmit information is loaded into the AN
XNP transmit register. After the COMPLETE ACKNOWLEDGE state has been entered, the link codeword
will be transmitted at least six times.

### 73.6.9 Next page
Next Page (NP) is encoded in bit D15
- `NP bit = 0`: device has no Next page to send
- `NP bit = 1`: device want to use Next page to sent to link partner

In case of device has no next page (`NP bit = 0`) but link partner has `NP bit = 1`, device will set `NP bit = 1` and transmit Next page with `NULL message` code


Defined in [[802.3-2015_SECTION5.pdf]] 
> Next Page (NP) is encoded in bit D15 of link codeword. Support of Next Pages is mandatory. If the device does not have any Next Pages to send, the NP bit shall be set to logical zero. If a device wishes to engage in Next Page exchange, it shall set the NP bit to logical one. If a device has no Next Pages to send and its link partner has set the NP bit to logical one, it shall transmit Next Pages with Null message codes and the NP bit set to logical zero while its link partner transmits valid Next Pages. Next page exchanges will occur if either the device or its link partner sets the Next Page bit to logical one. The Next Page function is defined in 73.7.7.

### 73.7.7 Next Page function

[[Next page]] uses [[Autoneg]] mechanisms to exchange the next pages

Defined in [[802.3-2015_SECTION5.pdf]] 
> The Next Page function uses the Auto-Negotiation arbitration mechanisms to allow exchange of Next Pages
of information, which may follow the transmission and acknowledgment procedures used for the base link
codeword. The Next Page has both Message code field and Unformatted code fields.

> Next page transmission ends when both ends of a link segment set their Next Page bits to logical zero,
indicating that neither has anything additional to transmit

#### 73.7.7.1

> The Next Page shall use the encoding shown in Figure 73–7 and Figure 73–8 for the NP, Ack, MP, Ack2,
and T bits. These bits shall function as specified in 28.2.3.4. There are two types of Next Page encodings—
message and unformatted. For message Next Pages, the MP bit shall be set to logical one, the 11-bit field
D[10:0] shall be encoded as a Message Code Field and D[47:16] shall be encoded as Unformatted Code
Field. For Unformatted Next Pages, the MP bit shall be set to logical zero; D[10:0] and D[47:16] shall be
encoded as the Unformatted Code Field.

## 73A.1 Message code 1—Null Message code

> The OUI tag code message shall consist of a Message Next Page with the message code field 000 0000 0101
followed by one Unformatted Next Page defined as follows. The unformatted code field of Message Next
Page 5 shall contain the most significant 11 bits of the OUI or CID (bits 23:13) in bits 26:16 (bits U0 to U10)
with the most significant OUI or CID bit in bit 26 (bit U10) of the unformatted code field, the next 11 most
significant bits of the OUI or CID (bits 12:2) in bits 42:32 (bit U26 to U16) with the most significant bit in
bit 42 (bit U26). The unformatted code field of the Unformatted Next Page shall contain the remaining least
significant 2 bits of the OUI or CID (bits 1:0) in bits 10:9 (U10 and U9) with OUI or CID bit 1 in bit 10 (bit
U10) with the bits 8:0, 26:16 (bits U8 to U0, U21 to U11) as a user-defined user code value that is specific to
the OUI or CID transmitted. The remaining unformatted code field bits in the Message Next Page and the
Unformatted Next Page shall be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

> For example, assume that a manufacturer’s IEEE-assigned OUI/CID value is AC-DE-48 and the
manufacturer-selected user-defined user code associated with the OUI or CID is 1100 1110 0001 1111 11002.
The message code values generated from these two numbers is encoded into the message Next Page and
Unformatted Next Page codes, as specified in Figure 73A–1. For clarity, the position of the global broadcast
g is illustrated.
