```
I would say these are our requirements at this point
1.	Supports duplex retimer at 56.25G and 53.125G @ PAM4 
2.	Support PRBS13 only at these rates. Both generator and checker
3.	We are booting from the flash memory so all the inbuilt arrays can be removed
4.	Any MDIO operation can be removed as we are I2C centric
```
