Hi aCuong

I would like to share my feedback about Mr.Vinh through the past year. Hopefully, you have an overview:

1.            How frequently did you work with the employee over the past year?

_> The first half past year, we more often co-work on CTC3 on checking/fixing API and GUI issues. Due to the COVID pandemic, he and I occasionally work together the second haft, mainly by chatting on Snack._

2.            What were the employee’s role and responsibilities in your work together?

_> Mainly we discussed the solution for development API and fixing issues. Sometimes I asked him for advice to do my jobs._

3.            How satisfied are you with what the employee accomplished with/or for you?

_> Neutrally, he usually gives me good advice, but I often ask someone else before asking him. He is good at many things except his communication with others._

4.            What are the employee’s strengths? 

Can you give specific examples of when you observed these strengths and how they helped you to achieve results?

_> He often has his different way to _acquire the_ solution for development or fix the issue efficiently._

_For example, by helping me check ANLT, while I take time to think the polling time makes firmware working abnormal, he located the issue on the regression framework._

5.            What are the employee’s opportunities for improvement? 

Can you give specific examples of when you observed the behavior(s) and how they impacted results?

_> Improving communication with other will help him and team do our job._

6.            Are there any additional insights you would like to share?

_> I have no idea :)_
