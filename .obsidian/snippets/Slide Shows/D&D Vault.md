## Mindset
> Built with the idea of having multiple of nearly everything.

- Multiple **Campaigns**
- Multiple **Universes**
- Multiple **TTRPG Systems**
- Multiple **Play Groups**

---

## Folders

Folder | Description |
---|---|
Campaigns | All notes relating to that specific adventure <br> *(ie. Session Notes, NPCs, Locations, etc)*
||
Universes | Notes about game mechanics and lore
||
Adventure Diary | Notes about events that occurred in the session
||
Character Database | Character sheets for player characters
||
10 Research | Notes on things I had to research for my TTRPGs
||
0 Archive <br> (Universes Archive) | Where non-active stuff goes to reduce clutter

---
## Campaigns
> Each campaign is in it's own folder

**Default Folders within a campaign are: **

Folders | Description |
---|---|
0 Session Notes | Notes I look at when I actually run the game
1 Story | Planning and outlining of the story of the campaign
NPCs | Other characters in the campaign
Locations | Notes Cities, towns, rooms, dungeons, etc
Items | Weapons, food, treasure, supplies, etc
Entities | Usually Stats, or lore about creatures
Organizations | Clans, groups, governments, etc

<br>

- Sometimes includes other folders like:
	- Encounters
	- Brainstorm
- All of which are added when needed (Grad Night Vault)

---
#### Campaign Files


File | Description |
---|---|
**Campaigns MOC** | Dataview table of my campaigns,<br> sorted by status
**Campaign Homepage**<br>(LMoP & Grad Nite) | Contains metadata for campaign
**Session Notes** <br> (Cragmaw Hideout & Phandalin) | - Heavily utilize Admonitions for branching choices/talking/visual distinction, <br> - Use Outline Plugin for traversal <br> - Leaflet when needing maps of locations

<br>

- Everything in session notes is designed/written for quickly glancing at needed information. 
- Rather not have to read huge paragraphs if reading lists is much faster for me

---
#### DM Screen

> Workspace for all the information I need while running the game<br>(Workspace Plus Plugin)

**Left** | **Right**................ | **Center**
---|---|---|
\- File Explorer & Search <br> - Special Sidebar SRD <br> - (School Vault inspiration: Info at side at all times and hover brings up info very quickly) <br> - Outline Core Plugin: hop to different sections in my Session Notes |  - Initiative Tracker <br>- Dice Roller | - Session Notes <br>- Combat Adjustment note <br> - Initiative Tracker's Encounter codeblock to quickly load in encounter into initative tracker
