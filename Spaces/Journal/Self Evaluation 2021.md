## Notes:

For the second half of 2020 - my first 6 months in Inphi, I have achieved many accomplishments as below:

- Work for inflight products of Arrive, maintain API and remote support some issues for the product of Fiberhome, SSDX. Almost those products were wrapped up in the first quarter. 
- Develop the first version of the new API/CLI then deploy a trial version on the Vega product. The purpose of this new API is to re-use all products to reduce resources for development and maintenance.
-  After investigating Vega and other products, having a look at current chip features, I then continued working with the API team to finalize the design of the new API. We applied that new API to CTC/CTC2 and further continue to deploy it to other products like Auriga, CTC3...
- By doing those tasks, I do know the API development process on coding, building, environment, and interworking with the GUI team to integrate new API with new GUI. I familiar with setting-up, testing onboard on some products like Vega, CTC, CTC2 after longtime practice on them.

Moreover, I demonstrated the “Customer” part of EPIC values by online support inflight products some customers such as Fiberhome, SSDX. And for the “People” part of EPIC values, I joined Wellness Challenge as a team leader role with global Inphi's staff, which is a great event to show Inphi's culture.
